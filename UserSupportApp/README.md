# UserSupportApp

The User Support App is a web application designed for operators to handle user support requests and provide timely assistance. It allows operators to manage incoming messages, respond to user inquiries, and search for messages based on their content.

## Key Features

- `Login`: To access the User Support App, operators need to have a separate account created directly in the database. The login form is available on the initial page, and upon successful authentication, operators are granted access to the support panel.

- `Message Management`: The User Support App displays a table with all incoming messages. Operators can view and manage unread messages, and by opening a message, its status is changed to "read." Operators can respond to messages by sending emails directly through the application.

- `Search`: The application allows operators to search for messages based on their content. This functionality helps operators quickly find relevant messages and provide efficient support to users.

## Technology Stack

The User Support App is implemented using JSP (JavaServer Pages) technology, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface. It leverages the following technologies and libraries:

- Java Server Pages (JSP)
- Servlets
- JavaBeans
- JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library)
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## UserSupportApp Setup

To run the "UserSupportApp" which is written using JSP technologies, you can follow the steps below:

- Ensure that you have a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

- Set up a web server that supports Java Servlet technology, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty. Download and install the web server of your choice by following the instructions provided on their respective websites.

- Build the UserSupportApp project by compiling the Java source files and creating a WAR (Web Application Archive) file.

- Deploy the WAR file to the web server you set up in step 2. The specific steps for deploying a WAR file may vary depending on the web server you are using. Refer to the documentation of your chosen web server for detailed instructions on deploying a web application.

- Start the web server. Once the server is up and running, you can access the UserSupportApp by opening a web browser and entering the appropriate URL. The exact URL will depend on the configuration of your web server and the context path of the deployed UserSupportApp.

Please note that JSP is a technology used for creating dynamic web pages using Java. The specific steps for running the UserSupportApp may vary based on the project structure and setup. The above steps provide a general overview of the process. It's recommended to consult the documentation or tutorials specific to your JSP framework or web server for more detailed instructions on running and deploying a JSP application.
